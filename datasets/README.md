# Datasets

## Directory Structure

The `datasets` folder in the current directory contains two subdirectories: `LIAR` and `GossipCop`, 
which store the respective datasets. All data is saved and read in `JSON` format.

## Field Descriptions
The structures of `train.json`, `val.json`, and `test.json` are identical and contain the following fields:
- **content**: The news text that needs to be evaluated for veracity.
- **llm_predict**: The LLMs prediction on the veracity of the news.
- **rationale_list**: A list of reasons generated by the LLMs based on the veracity prediction, containing the following subfields:
  - **analytical_perspective**: The perspective from which the reason is provided.
  - **rationale**: The specific rationale given by the LLM.
- **label**: The veracity label of the news content, where 0 indicates real news and 1 indicates fake news.
- **source_id**: A unique identifier for each data entry.

## Accessing the Dataset
You may generate your own dataset by using the news texts from the LIAR and GossipCop source datasets along with the provided [sample_data](./sample_data.json).
